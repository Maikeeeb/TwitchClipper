# Contributing

Thanks for contributing. This document defines the minimum standards for
changes and reviews.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] Scope is focused and changes are easy to review
- [ ] README/docs updated if user-facing behavior changed
- [ ] Tests updated or added for behavior changes
- [ ] CI is green (lint/format/tests)
- [ ] No secrets or local config files are committed

## Coding standards

- Follow the rules in `AGENTS.md`
- Keep logic explicit and readable
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless necessary
- Keep files under formatter limits

## Documentation expectations

- Update `docs/repo_overview.md` when structure or entry points change
- Update `docs/architecture.md` when boundaries or invariants change
