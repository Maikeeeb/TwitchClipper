# Template philosophy (short)

This repo is a starter template designed to enforce consistent standards across
projects while staying minimal and easy to customize.

## What you must customize

- **Project identity**: name, description, and owner
- **Entry points**: CLI/API/UI commands and scripts
- **CI**: workflows and commands in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Testing**: test commands and coverage expectations
- **Docs**: repo overview, architecture, and deployment notes

## Getting started

Use `docs/setup.md` as the source of truth for first-time setup. It guides the first
agent through placeholder resolution and repo cleanup.
